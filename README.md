## Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter have become a valuable source of information for cybersecurity professionals. Many cybersecurity experts use Twitter to share information about the latest threats and potential IOC’s that could help identify and prevent attacks. However, manually collecting and analyzing this data can be time-consuming and challenging.

To address this challenge, I decided to write a Jupyter Notebook that can automate the process of collecting IOC’s from Twitter and putting them in Microsoft Sentinel using MSTICPy.
